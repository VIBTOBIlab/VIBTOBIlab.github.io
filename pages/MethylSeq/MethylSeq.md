## Introduction

> **Note:** This pipeline has been modified using the original nf-core/methylseq pipeline (version 2.6.0) to include the optical removal duplicates and some other modules in the Bismark subworkflow. You can find the original pipeline at the following [nfcore repository](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/2.6.0).

**MethylSeq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for Methylation (Bisulfite) sequencing data. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker / Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources.The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/results).

## Pipeline Summary

The pipeline allows you to choose between running either [Bismark](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark) or [bwa-meth](https://github.com/brentp/bwa-meth) / [MethylDackel](https://github.com/dpryan79/methyldackel).
Choose between workflows by using `--aligner bismark` (default, uses bowtie2 for alignment), `--aligner bismark_hisat` or `--aligner bwameth`.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
SRR389222_sub1,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub1.fastq.gz
SRR389222_sub2,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub2.fastq.gz
SRR389222_sub3,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/SRR389222_sub3.fastq.gz
Ecoli_10K_methylated,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/Ecoli_10K_methylated_R1.fastq.gz,https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/raw/methylseq/testdata/Ecoli_10K_methylated_R2.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --input samplesheet.csv --outdir <OUTDIR> --genome GRCh37 -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/usage), the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/parameters) and the section below for the parameters that have been added to the modifed version of the pipeline.

## Parameters included in the modified version

The original [nf-core/methylseq pipeline](https://nf-co.re/methylseq/2.6.0/) has been modified to include modules that are important when processing RRBS/cfRRBS samples. The pipeline has been modified by @edogiuili and is currently maintained by Edoardo Giuili ([@edogiuili](https://github.com/edogiuili)) and Sofie Van de Velde ([@sofvdvel](https://github.com/sofvdvel)).

### Removal of optical duplicates

#### `--remove_optic_duplicates`
If specified, it removes the optical duplicates. It can be used together with `--sequencer` (see below).

#### `--sequencer`
If the flag `--remove_optic_duplicates` has been specified, `--sequencer` will be by default set to **NovaSeq**. Alternatively, you can specify **HiSeq** or **NextSeq**. This will change the OpticalDupsPixelDistance within PicardMarkDuplicates step (**NovaSeq**: 12000, **HiSeq**: 2500, **NextSeq**: 100).

### Filter non conversion (Bismark) module

#### `--filter_non_conversion`
If specified, it filters out all those reads that have a methylation value >= than a preset threshold in non-CG context where you expect a very low methylation level (<5% usually). For more information please consult the [Bismark usage](https://felixkrueger.github.io/Bismark/bismark/filter_nonconverted_reads/). 

#### `--minimum_count`
Minimum number of methylation sites for a read to be filtered out (def. 3).

#### `--percentage_cutoff`
Minimum methylation percentage for a read to be filtered out (def. 90%).

### Sequencing saturation plots
> [NOTE:] It's recommended only when using RRBS data, while with WGBS it's recommended to look at the results provided by PreSeq module.

When the flag `--rrbs` is specified, the pipeline will perform a downsampling of the raw aligned .bam files and calculate the sequencing saturation. The sequencing saturation is calculated as the number of unique CpGs with at least x counts (where x is 3 by default, but can be customized) divided by the theoretical maximum number of CpG (which corresponds to the asymptote of the curve). 

#### `--downsampling_percentages`
The percentages to use when performing the downsampling (def. "0.1,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1"). This parameter cannot accept 0. It's strongly recommended to no change it, unless there are valid reasons (e.g. your sequencing saturation curve is not informative enough with the default percentages.)

#### `--min_counts`
The minimum number of reads necessary to call a unique CpGs in the sequencing curve. By default, it will use '1,3,5' corresponding respectively to 1, 3 and 5 reads.

#### `--skip_seqcurve`
If you are using the `--rrbs` flag and you want to skip the sequencing saturation curve process, activate this flag (def. false).
